* Ohai Emacs

While it is certainly true that Emacs is the most powerful text editor in the world, your first impression of it may be less favourable, because its default configuration really just isn't all that great.

But now there is Ohai Emacs! Simply install Ohai Emacs as your emacs.d, and you will be ready to bask in the full radiance of Holy Emacs in no time at all.

There is even a configuration [[https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/8443050752/h55957A15/][wizard]]!

[[./.ohai-emacs/ohai-emacs.jpg]]

** Installation

If you don't have it installed already, go get a copy of [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/#Obtaining][GNU Emacs]] version 24.4 or later.

If you have an emacs.d already, move it out of the way (~mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak~) or get rid of it (~rm -rf ~/.emacs.d~) first.

To download Ohai Emacs as your new emacs.d:

#+begin_src sh
$ git clone https://github.com/bodil/ohai-emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

That's it! Now, the next time you start Emacs, Ohai Emacs will ask you a few questions about how you like things to be, and go on the internets and download some fresh packages for you. In a little while, it will be ready for your emacsing.

** Usage

A full feature list is pending. A quick overview:

*** Learning From Emacs Lisp

While Ohai Emacs helps you get started quickly and without frustration, you must eventually learn Emacs Lisp in order to become an Emacs Master. The Ohai Emacs source code contains numerous comments designed to explain, often in detail, what it's doing. The best (if not the fastest) way to learn what Ohai Emacs can do for you is to read the source.

Start at ~.emacs.d/init.el~. This sets up the basic environment, and loads each Ohai Emacs module from the ~.emacs.d/modules~ directory in turn. Read through the ~.el~ file in the module directory that are of interest to you, and you will find they explain the changes they make, often pointing you to useful documentation for the more powerful features.
