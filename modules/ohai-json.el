;;; Commentary:

;; This file is not a proper module; it's loaded by both ohai-javascript
;; and ohai-js-web-mode.

;;; Code:

;; Install json-mode and make its reformat keybinding match the global default.
(use-package json-mode
  :commands json-mode

             ("C-c <tab>" . json-mode-beautify)))
